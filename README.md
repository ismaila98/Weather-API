# WeatherPy & VacationPy
------------------------------------

### Overview
------------
In the WeatherPy deliverable, we're visualizing the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. We'll be using OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from a randomly selected list of cities across the world. Then we'll statistically analyze the relationship between Latitude and Humidity, Temperature, Wind Speed and Cloudiness in Northern and Southern Hemisphere. In the VacationPy deliverable, we'll be using our findings from WeatherPy to filter out cities by desired temperature and cloudiness levels. Then we'll Use GeoApify to find the nearest hotels in list of cities that meets the weather criteria.
